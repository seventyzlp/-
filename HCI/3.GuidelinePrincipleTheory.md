# Guidelines - specific and practial (narrowly focused use)

## what is
developed in the "early days"
- best Practices: Windows and Apple UI
- from experience: interface designers
## component
1. Rules(specific and practical)
   - cures for disign 
2. examples
   - details on how a design must be performed
3. document
   - shared document
   - build upon good experience. continue improvements
   - too specific
## general guidelines
1. Navigating the interface - NCI
   - embedded links are descriptive
2. guidelines for disabled - WCAG
3. display organization guidelines
   - consistency of data display
   - efficient information assimilation by user
   - minial memory load on the user
     - lable and common formats for novice users
     - few actions
     - minmal information
   - only a starting point
4. get user attention
   - intensity
   - marking
   - size
   - fonts
5. data entry guidelines
   - minimal input actions
   - consistency of data entry transactions
   - minimal memory load
   - compatibility of data entry with data display
   - flexibility for user control of data display
# principles - mid (widely applicable and enduring)
"golden rules"
more fundamental, widly acceptable, enduring than guidelines

- fundamental principles for all UI
- determint users skill levels / sprial design strategy --> multi-layer strategy
  - know the user --> population profile --> design goals based on skill level
    - novice or first-time users
      - grand-parents sending first email
      - airport kiosks
      - solutions
        - restrict vocabulary
        - providing help
        - small number of actions
        - feedback --  good error messages
        - documents
    - knowledgeable intermittent users
      - locate feature
      - retain structure of menus
      - solutions
        - consistent sequences of actions
        - meaningful feedback
        - undo is powerful --> encourage users to explore more
    - expert frequent users
      - effciency
      - solution
        - rapid response time
        - brief feed back
        - accelerator
  - minimize memorization
  - optimize operations
- indentify the task of application
    - limited funcitionality -> universal usability
    - user-needs assessment
- five primary interaction styles --> choose an interation style
  - direct manipulation -> visual, eazy to remember
    - pros
      - fast
      - feedback
      - easy to understand and retain
      - exploration encouraged
      - good for novices
      - can be good for visual data
  - menu selection
    - make actions understandable not easy, careful task analysis
    - adaptive menu
  - form-fill in
    - useful for intermittent users for frequent users
    - pro
      - rapid
      - tools avaliable for forms
    - cons
      - under request format
      - able to respond errors
      - training required
  - command language
    - expert frequent users
    - pro
      - feeling of control
      - felxibility
    - con
      - high error rates
      - training required
      - poor retention rate
  - natural language
    - easy to learn
    - ubpredictable, technology not fully developed
- eight golden rules for interface design
  1. strive for consistency
     - consistent sequence of actions for similar situations
     - identical terminology should bee used in prompts, menus, help screens
     - consistent font..
  2. cater to universal usability
     - recognize the need of a diverse user group
     - disign for plasticity -- any type display
  3. offer informative feedback
     - what is going on  
  4. design dialogs to yield closure
  5. permit easy reversal of actions -- undo sth
  6. support internal locus of control
     - experiences operators want to feel control 
  7. reduce short term memory load
     - keep display simple
  8. prevent errors --- handy message
     - limit errors a user can make
       - correct actions
       - compelete sequences
     - in case of errors
       - detect error
       - simple, constuctive, specific instructions --> better error messages
       - don't change system rate
- prevention of errors

# theories - high (tested, proven, broadly useful)
beyond the specifics of guidlines
Donald Norman
1. to get sth done, you start with some notion of what is wanted -- the goal to be achieved
2. then do something to the world -- take action to move yourself or manipulate someone or something
3. check the outcome

## Human action models
- seven stages of action theory
  1. forming the goal
  2. forming the intension -- mentally selects and interface function to perform the intended action
  3. specifying the action -- specifying the sequence of interface actions in order to carry out the intention formed
  4. excuting the action
  5. perceving the system state
  6. interpreting the system state
  7. evaluating the outcome
- four critical points where user failures can occur
  1. users can form an inadequate goal -- high light what can do
  2. might not find the correct interface object
  3. nay not know how to specify or execute a desired action
  4. may receive inappropriate or misleading feedback
- gulf of excution
  - the gulf of execution -- mismatch between users intension and system provide
  - the gulf of evaluation -- mismatch between system representation and users want
- avoid gulf errors, four principles of good design
  1. have a good conceptual model with a consistent system image
  2. state and the action alternatives should be visible
  3. inferface should include good mappings that reveal the relationships between stages
  4. user should receive continuous feedback
