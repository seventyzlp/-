# Three Pillars of Design
0. Ethnogorphic Observation -> user interfaces requirements.
   -  enthogography -- long term observation of users in their natural environments -- when no solution
      -  4 steps to do
         -  Preparation
            -  understand organization policies and work culture
            -  familiar yourself with the system and history
            -  set initial goals and prepare questions
            -  gain access and permission to observie/interview
         -  Field Study
            -  get permition from comitee
            -  get permision from users
            -  observe data
         -  analysis
            -  compile the collected data in numerical, textual, multimedia database
         -  reporting
            -  consider multiple autidences and goals
   - participatory design -- users willing to join
     - involve all stakeholders
     - invited to participate
     - pros
       - more user involvement brings
       - accurate
       - opporunity for users to influence
       - acceptence
     - cons
       - costly
       - lengthen implentation period
  
1. Theories & models
2. Algorithms & prototypes
3. controlled experiments

## involving the user
- meet and talk
- explain designs
- have visuals / demos

# Prototyping
- traditionally users lack the ability to envisage designs conceptually
- alternatively the may be a conceptual mismatch between
- get feed back on design faster
- experiment with alternative designs
- fix problems before code is written
- keep design centered on the user
- easier to change or throw away
## Lo-fi
low level of details
- story boarding
- "Sketching is about design"
  - create
  - record
  - reflect, share, critique, decide
- Include what
  - main inferface itself
  - different modes and transitions of the interface
## Hi-fi
exact similar as final product
high level of details.

## Feedback
- previews and feedback from prototypes is crucial

## evaluating
1. expert review
   - Heuristic evaluation -- any stage
     - personal criticism
     - spend time evaluating the interface "pay"
     - Heuristic
       - no ture formal approach
       - effective
       - cheaper than a full user study
   - Guidelines review -- hi-fi prototype / more detailed lofi / final
     - assume have a guideline document
     - scrutinize the UI to make sure it adhere to the guidelines
     - "bird eye" to review the UI
     - some one master of the guideline to take few weeks
   - Consistency inspection  -- hi-fi prototype / final
   - Cognitive walkthrough
     - stimulating users walking through the interface
     - watch how they do it
     - see if they behave the way you thought they would
     - useful if app is geared for group the designers might not familiar
   - Formal usability inspection -- all stage
     - courtroom like settings -- justify the design
     - trainning property
     - explain the design
   - ISSUES
     - some expert can't see the general public
2. usability testing and labs -- final stage?
   - participants
   - Google put the lab to public area
   - Techniques
     - Recording
       - logging software
       - videotaping -- need time stamp, participants may anxious
       - thinkaloud -- saying what they are thinking, record
       - eyetracking
       - paper mockups
       - discount usability testing
       - ..
   - ISSUE
     - voluntry, informed consent should be obtained
     - need institutional approval
3. questionnaires / surveys
   - familiar, inexpensive, generally acceptable, online (surveymonkey)
   - clear goals in advance
   - focused items
   - Design questions
     - ideally
       - based on existing questions
       - reviewed by colleagues
       - pilot tested
     - direct activities are better ahan gathering statistics
     - important to pre-test questions
4. acceptance testing
  prove the app is better than others. -- 5 human factors
  set objective and measurable goals for hardware and software porducts.
  may take few months for different user communities.
5. continuous feedback
  constant attention.
  - interviews and focus group discussions
  - continuous user-performance data logging -- usage pattern
  - online / telephone consultants
  - online suggestion box
  - discussion group / mewsgroup

include
- stage of design
- novelty of project
- criticality of the interface
- costs of product and finances allocated for testing
- time available
- experience
- uncertainty remains even after exhaustive testing by multiple people
