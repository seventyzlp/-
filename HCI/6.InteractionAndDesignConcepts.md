# interaction types

## major interaction types
- communciation
  - instruction (feedback)
    - give instruction to computer -> commonand lines / menu selection
    - difference between manipulation
      - multiple steps to prepare instruction, submitted only at the end
      - action may not be instaneous
  - conversation
    - substaintial feedback
      - may not follow instruction directly, ask for clarfication -> turn taking, like a dialogue
    - based on Speech Act Theory
      - Assert, Direct, Commit, Express, Declare
    - Terry Winograd's Conversation for action schema
- manipulation
  - object manipulation
    - manipulate virtual objects, items, tokens
    - drag and drop icons into folders
  - ego manipulation (virtual self)
    - user move their mental selves around
    - 3d games, google street view
- Peripheral feedback
  - little attention needed
  - users may not respond, or ignore
  - Modeless feedback, AR, Ambient Devices / Calm computing
- Interaction Attributes
  - Interactivity : How actively
    - related to rate of HCI circle and affected by
      - time it takes for users to input the action
      - time it take for the comupter to respond
        - manipulation respond lag may detected 170ms and up
    - communciation-based interaction has a slow circle
    - minipulation-based  has a very rapid cycle as feedback
    - greater interactivity
      - more engaging experience
      - greater computer cost
  - Intuitiveness
    - related to ease of using an interface
    - about users familiarity with previous software
    - should apply for as wide a range of past experoence as possible

# Software Behavior
- software posture
  - sovereign
    - monopolize user's attention for extended duration
    - major application
  - transient
    - briefly capture user's attention form time to time
    - sidebar gadgets, chat notification
  - daemonic
    - mostly silent / invisible, very rarely captureing user's attention
    - network and volume icons in the system tray
- empathetic software behavior
  - negative affects in user interaction
    - frustration / anger - unnecessary effort or difficulty in using interface
    - fear / distress - wrong but irreversible action
- considerate software behavior
  - Proactive
    - know user's habits -> auto-fill
    - anticipate needs -> preload linked pages
  - Flexible
    - easily reversible
    - don't force the user
    - adaptive
    - fail gracefully -> auto-recover
  - Deferential
    - avoid informing user of non-cirtical internal problems
    - avoid asking unnecessary questions
- Anthropomorphism
  - give human attributes to software
  - suitable for some groups of users and some application types
  - chatbots
  - avatars
  - combined -> Cleverbot
  - consider -> gender, personality

# Desgin concepts

- Affordances
  - attribute of an item, object or structure, permitting a user to perform some basic action
  - well-designed item have clearly perceived affordance
  - affordance does not define effect
- metaphors
  - computer interactions mapping to real-world interactions that users are more familiar with
  - advantages
    - good metaphors reduce gulfs of execution and evaluation
    - users understand better what can or cannot be done
  - disadvantages
    - bad metaphors can confuse users
- Idioms
  - very widely-used actions, span platfroms / software -> not in real world but familiar
  - most GUI elements are idiomatic, not metaphoric
- choice limitation
  - quickly get users to learn idiomatic actions
  - provide noticeable constraints to lead users toward allowable actions
- context awareness
  - choice limitation may not be enough
  - may be able to use context to help distinguish
  - ambiguous search terms
  - 3d modeling with 2d GUI

# Design patterns

- reusable past solutions to resign problems
- types of desgin patterns
  - templates
    - near-complete design prototypes
    - website templates -> material UI @google
  - widgets / controls
    - basic high-level GUI components
    - buttons / sliders
  - desgin laguage and guidelines
    - prescribe expected look and feel of application UI
  - graphical user inferface builders
    - software to visually design user interfaces
    - able to generate some automatic code
