	abstract = {Gaze-contingent variable resolution display techniques allocate computational resources for image generation preferentially to the area around the center of gaze where visual sensitivity to detail is the greatest. Although these techniques are computationally efficient, their behavioral consequences with realistic tasks and materials are not well understood. The behavior of human observers performing visual search of natural scenes using gaze-contingent variable resolution displays is examined. A two-region display was used where a high-resolution region was centered on the instantaneous center of gaze, and the surrounding region was presented in a lower resolution. The radius of the central high-resolution region was varied from 1 to 15 degrees while the total amount of computational resources required to generate the visual display was kept constant. Measures of reaction time, accuracy, and fixation duration suggest that task performance is comparable to that seen for uniform resolution displays when the central region size is approximately 5 degrees.},

This paper summarizes results from a series of 6 studies investigating spatial, resolutional, and temporal parameters affecting perception and performance in such eye-contingent multi-resolutional displays. Based on the results of these studies, suggestions are made for the design of eye-contingent multi-resolutional displays.},

	abstract = {We direct our gaze at an object by rotating our eyes or head until the object's projection falls on the fovea, a small region of enhanced spatial acuity near the center of the retina. In this paper, we explore methods for encorporating gaze direction into rendering algorithms. This approach permits generation of images exhibiting continuously varying resolution, and allows these images to be displayed on conventional television monitors. Specifically, we describe a ray tracer for volume data in which the number of rays cast per unit area on the image plane and the number of samples drawn per unit length along each ray are functions of local retinal acuity. We also describe an implementation using 2D and 3D mip maps, an eye tracker, and the Pixel-Planes 5 massively parallel raster display system. Pending completion of Pixel-Planes 5 in the spring of 1990, we have written a simulator on a Stellar graphics supercomputer. Preliminary results indicate that while users are aware of the variable-resolution structure of the image, the high-resolution sweet spot follows their gaze well and promises to be useful in practice.},
