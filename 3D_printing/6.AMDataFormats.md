# STL format
stereolithography 
binary format / ascii format
list of triangular facets representing the outside surfaces.

Autodesk, SolidWorks

## Tessellation
process of approximating original surfaces you want with trangles / quad.
low trangles -> rough / low resolution

the small chord height, the smoother the surfaces.

## pros
- provide simple method of representing 3d CAD data
- a de facto standard and has been used by most CAD systems and AM systems
- provides small


# STL file problems
- duplicated vertices and edges -> many times larger than orginal CAD file
- CAD models not robust to generate the facet model -> geomtery flaws exist in the STL file -> need repair software
- slicing of large STL files can make many errors
- no topological data
- check errors and repair

common errors
1. Gaps in stl file
2. degenerate facet
3. overlapping facets
4. non-manifold conditions
